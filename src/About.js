      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Programming has always been my passion. Right now I&apos;m software
        engineer and I&apos;m programming home automation solutions, as well as
        developing software for electric vehicle charging stations. For some
        time I&apos;m learning about web technologies. I think that the
        technical studies I have completed (Mechatronics at the Rzesz√≥w
        University of Technology), will help me to understand real problems and
        find their solutions.
